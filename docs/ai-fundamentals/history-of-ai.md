## Early Beginnings (1950s-1970s) üèõÔ∏è

The concept of AI began as a theoretical pursuit in the mid-20th century. Some foundational events during this era include:

- **1950**: Alan Turing, a British mathematician, introduced the idea of machines being able to think in his paper "Computing Machinery and Intelligence," proposing the famous **Turing Test** to assess a machine's ability to exhibit intelligent behavior indistinguishable from that of a human.
- **1956**: The term **"Artificial Intelligence"** was coined by John McCarthy during the Dartmouth Conference, marking the official birth of AI as a field of study.
- **1966**: The first AI chatbot, **ELIZA**, was created by Joseph Weizenbaum. ELIZA demonstrated early natural language processing, simulating conversation with humans.

During this period, AI was primarily based on symbolic approaches and rule-based systems, with a focus on logical reasoning and problem-solving.
